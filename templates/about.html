<p>I have had many jobs and interests, but three things that I have repeatedly been involved with are swimming, finance, and technology.</p>

<p><b>Technology</b><br>
Over my lifetime, every time I come back to my technology hobbies, the projects get bigger. This is the field that I'd like to focus my talents and future efforts.</p>
<p>In middle school I taught myself HTML and got a job updating our swim team's website. I did everything in notepad and would FTP my changes to the server. I learned a lot, and I think I only stopped that job because my time commitment to swim training grew into about 20+ hours per week in high school.</p>
<p> In college, I spent many late nights at the library writing a VBA driven excel program that simulated various stock trading patterns with yahoo historical stock data. Before even typing a single line of code, I had mapped out pseudo-code and how I thought the data would flow through the modular program. Truthfully, had I known a better language like python, I probably could have done the entire thing without any excel involvement. However, I think VBA wasn't a horrible first language. I learned about arrays, variables, types, for loops, and much more. There was no such thing as stackoverflow.com back then, and I remember just chugging along "trial and error", until I finally had the code doing what I wanted it to do. It was extremely satisfying to map out a plan, and then follow through with the actual implimentation.</p>

<p>In the last year, I've really jumped head first into programming. I've learned Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. <a href="/blog/view/mockompa">I've built a web scraper that feeds into a python coded swim meet scoring script</a>. Currently, I'm working on a swim workout generating website with my friend Mark Shveyd. He's handling the swim workout side of things, while I implement the technology. <a href="/blog/view/poctoproduct">So far it's using django, bootstrap, MySQL and some custom python scripts.</a> Seeing as I have taken a natural progression from learning python to implementing python scripts that talk with django web apps, I'd like to take a similar path with JavaScript. I've learned much of the syntax, but I'd like to learn more about web frameworks that make use of it.</p>

<p><b>Finance</b><br>
I've always had an interest in how the world works. I think it's natural for that sort of thinking to lead to one of the many big drivers: Finance. More specifically: how does money, capital, and economics drive the world? In college I majored in economics (as well as biology), and loved learning about how the system lived in an ever-precious state of balance. After college I worked for a small commercial real estate investment company. I used a program called Argus to create discounted cash flow models of various buy, lease-up-the-space and re-sell scenarios over 3 to 5 year holding periods. Wanting to try out "consulting", I then worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers as an associate in the consulting arm of the company. <a href="/blog/view/47return">Since then I've also logged a lot of experience trading my own funds in the stock market.</a></p>

<p><b>Swimming</b><br>
I've been competitively swimming since I was 6 years old. Believe it or not, that was "starting late" in the insanely swimming oriented Orinda/Moraga area of SF east bay. I eventually caught up to my peers and had a memorable swimming career that spanned year round swimming, summer club swimming, water polo, and high school swimming. </p>

<p>Although I was recruited to swim at Southern Methodist University, two shoulder injuries forced me to re-evaluate how I could be a part of the sport. I began coaching some of the very same spring-summer-fall (semi-year round) private swim clubs that I grew up swimming with. What started out as a college-summer-job grew into something bigger each consecutive year: I kept getting recruited to take on higher up coaching positions. Eventually, a sociological change occurred where what had originally been a swim league run by college swimmers working summer jobs in the 90s, was by 2010 a swim league run by full-time professional coaches. As of now, 8 of the 9 teams have professional coaches. All in all, I've coached for 8 years, and have led: spring-summer-fall swim teams of 250 swimmers, staff hiring/training for $30,000 budgets, advanced stroke clinics, dive clinics, private swim lessons, and high school swim team. I've been able to see it from every angle having been: swimmer, volunteer coach, jr coach, assistant coach, assistant head coach, co-head coach and head coach. I'm currently in my second year serving as the Head JV Coach at Miramonte High School, and my second year as Head Coach at Moraga Ranch Swim Club. </p>
